# VectorDatabase
1: Building the Vector Store: 
- Ingest documents and metadata.
- Convert raw text into chunks.
- Represent each chunk as a vector using a text embedding model.
- Store vectors in a vector database.
2. Embedding the User Query:
- Embed the user's query into the same vector space as the documents.
3. Semantic Search:
- Find the closest vector matches to the query from the vector store.
- Retrieve the top K most relevant chunks or documents.
- Use search and indexing strategies from vector databases for efficiency.
4. Performance Optimization:
- Employ a cache mechanism to store frequently accessed results.
- Implement a re-ranking layer to fine-tune the retrieved results.
5. Generative Search:
- Pass the prompt, query, and retrieved relevant documents to a large language model (LLM).
- LLM generates a unique response, leveraging retrieved documents for context and accuracy.
6. Retrieval-Augmented Generation:
- Combines semantic search (finding relevant documents) with LLMs (generating responses) for enhanced accuracy.
